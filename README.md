# libft specs

For my first project in C I wanted to apply what I had learnt with Rspec and rails.
Here are the tests for my first project as a Ecole 42 student.

To launch tests do these steps in your terminal.
```bash
make test
./test
```

Launching the executable with 1, 2 or 3 will execute only that part of the test suite. All tests are executed if no argument is given.
